Lab 2.1 Top k numbers with highest frequency

This Java program identifies the top K numbers with the highest frequency from a user-defined array. It uses a 2D array to store each unique number and its frequency. The findTopKFrequent method first counts frequencies, then sorts the array in descending order of frequency (and by value if frequencies match). Finally, it outputs the top K frequent numbers. The main method handles input for the array and the K value and calls the frequency method to display the result.

Lab 2.2 Maximum Profit

This Java program calculates the maximum profit a trader can make with at most two stock transactions within a day. The program uses two arrays: profitLeft (tracking maximum profit if selling on or before each day) and profitRight (tracking maximum profit if buying on or after each day). By combining the results from both arrays, it finds the maximum profit achievable from two non-overlapping transactions. The main method takes no. of days and stock prices as input and displays the maximum profit.
