Lab 1.1 Credit card number validation

This Java program validates a credit card number . The program first removes the last digit of the input number and reverses the remaining digits. It then processes each digit, doubling the digits at odd positions and summing them. If a doubled digit is greater than or equal to 10, the digits are split and summed. Finally, the program checks if the last digit matches the calculated checksum. If they match, the card is considered valid; otherwise, it's invalid.

Lab 1.2 Alphabet War Game

This Java program, AlphabetWarGame, simulates a game where two teams (left and right) compete based on the strength of characters in a word or two separate words. The program has two constructors: one with default strengths for characters (w, p, b, s, m, q, d, z) and another that allows users to input custom strengths. The game compares the strength of characters in either a single word or two separate words (left and right). Based on the total strength of the characters, the program declares which team wins, or if it's a tie.
